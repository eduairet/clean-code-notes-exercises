# Introduction

## Clean Code

- Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain, it has low complexity, and it is easy to test.
- Even if the code works, it doesn't mean it's clean, and that's what these notes are about.
- Examples of bad code:
  - Complex nestings
  - Unhandled errors
  - Unintuitive names
  - Big code blocks
  - They won't follow common best practices and design patterns
- Examples of clean code:
  - Readable and meaningful names
  - Slim, concise, and focused methods
  - Understandable and maintainable code flow
- It's important to understand that clean code is a way of thinking and it's not attached to a specific programming language.
- There are patterns and principles that are more common in some languages, but the idea of clean code is universal.

## Clean Architecture

- Clean architecture is about where to put the code, how to structure it, and how to separate concerns.

## Refactoring

- Refactoring is the process of changing the structure of the code without changing its behavior.
- It's about improving the code quality, making it cleaner, and easier to understand.
